<!--  
    1. Overview The visual components that make up the user interface are:
        0. Multiple sections:
            i. A list of currently owned fish
            ii. A list of all the places that he's visited to collect fish
        a. An aside explaining tank cleaning protocols, water salinity and temperature.
        b. No navigation bar, yet.
        c. Helpful quotes on the page ethat lists all of the out-of-the-way places Martin has visited. Right above the list of locations.
        d. The details of the fish should include the image, species, length, his name for the fish, where it was harvested, and what it eats.

    Data Design: 
    1. The properties of each fish that will be represented in HTML are: the image, species, length, name of fish, where it was harvested, and what it eats.
    2. The fish care tips to be mentioned are: Tank cleaning protocols, water salinity and temperature.
    3. The properties of the locations that Martin has visited that he wants mentioned are: Travel tips for people who love to scuba and harvest fish. 

    Style and Layout Design:
    1. The class names for components:
        a. Location for the container element for all locations, locations__header for the header, location for each individual card.
        b. Fishes for the container element for all locations, fishes_header for the header, fish for each individual card.
        c. Quotes for the container element for all quotes, quotes__header for the header, quote for each individual quote.
        d. Protocols for the container element (aside) for all protocols, protocols__header for the header, protocol for each individual card.
    2. The semantic tags that I will use:
        a. header, aside, main, section, article.
